* DONE 8 duds and 1 armed bomb.
  CLOSED: [2018-05-03 Thu 11:18]
Some idiot forgot to disarm a bomb that is laid in the 'decomisioned' bomb pile.
Unfortunately the only way to tell which bomb is armed is to use a special weighing system.
To add insult to injury we don't know if the armed bomb weighs less or more on the system just that it weighs differently.
But there is yet another catch the weighing system only have two charges left, but it can weight any number of bombs at once.
Your job is to tell which 1 bomb out of the 9 bombs is armed while only using the weighing machine twice.

Answer: 
split 9 bombs into 3 groups of 3. 
weigh 1: group 1 and group 2
If group 1 and group 2 are different weights
   the heavier group has the armed bomb in it.
   weigh 2: weigh 2 of the bombs from the heavier group
   If one of the bombs weighs more that is the armed bomb
   Otherwise the bomb that was not weighed is the armed bomb
If group 1 and group 2 are the same weight
   the armed bomb is in group 3
   weigh 2: weigh 2 of the bombs from group 3
   If one of the bombs weighs more that is the armed bomb
   Otherwise the bomb that was not weighed is the armed bomb

The Shoe Shack has made several top-dollar sales today. 
Using only the clues below, match each customer to their foot size, 
shoe brand and final purchase price.

No option in any category will ever be used more than once.  

1. The $185 pair was 4 sizes smaller than Natalie's pair.
2. The Cormano footwear was somewhat smaller than the Williford footwear.
3. The Schtillet footwear was somewhat larger than Marie's pair.
4. The $125 pair was somewhat larger than Marie's pair.
5. Lucia's pair wasn't made by Tinghill.
6. Of the $185 pair and the size 9 set, one was bought by Francine and the other was by Graffetz.
7. The $245 pair wasn't made by Tinghill.
8. The $260 pair was 2 sizes larger than Vanessa's pair.
9. The Williford footwear was 1 size smaller than Francine's pair.
10. The $125 pair was 2 sizes smaller than Ruth's pair.
11. The $215 pair was 5 sizes smaller than the $170 pair.
12. The $185 pair was 2 sizes smaller than Lucia's pair.
13. The Schtillet footwear was either Ruth's pair or the size 5 set.
14. The Abbott Hill footwear was 5 sizes larger than the $215 pair.
15. The Williford footwear was 1 size smaller than the $245 pair.

| Shoe Sizes | Customers | Brands     | Prices |
|          4 | Marie     | Graffetz   | $185   |
|          5 | Vanessa   | Schtillet  | $215   |

  Let /p/ and /q/ be the propositions:

  /p/: I studied.

  /q/: I got an A on the test.

  Express each of the propositions below as an English sentence:
  1. /p/ \rarr /q/
  2. \not /p/ \lor \not /q/
  3. \not /p/ \rarr (p \lor q)
  4. \not /p/ \rarr \not /q/

  1. p \rarr q
     I studied only if I got an A on the test.
  
  2. \not p \lor \not q
     I did not study or I did not get an A on the test.

  3. \not p \rarr (p \lor q)
     I did not study only if I either studied or got an A on the test.

  4. \not p \rarr \not q

Please Complete all Problems and Puzzles including the 'optional ones', but skipping the exercises.
I would recommend working together.  As always I will give out hints
periodically.

(NOTE:I would keep all your exercises/problems/puzzles you do, if you
take DM 2, you may find these extreeeeeeeeeemly helpful, or not)
